# Web Flask

This was a sub-project within AirBnB in which I began working with Flask
and Jinja2. In this project, I began integrating the back-end storage engine
with the web static HTML/CSS pages written earlier.
 
```
~ $ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost
HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m web_flask.100-hbnb
```

The app can be accessed at `0.0.0.0:5000/hbnb`.
